2. **GitHub Account:** Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
3. **Visual Studio Code:** Install Visual Studio Code. [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

### Step 1: Install Git
1. Download the Git installer from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts, accepting the default options.

### Step 2: Install VSCode
1. Download VSCode from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install VSCode.

### Step 3: Configure Git in VSCode
1. Open VSCode.
2. Open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
3. Type `Git: Clone` and select it.
4. You will be prompted to enter a repository URL. Enter the URL of your GitHub repository or use one of your own repositories.

### Step 4: Cloning a Repository
1. Go to your GitHub repository page.
2. Click the `Code` button and copy the URL of the repository.
3. Go back to VSCode, paste the URL, and press Enter.
4. Choose a folder where you want to clone the repository.

### Step 5: Open the Repository in VSCode
1. After cloning, VSCode will prompt you to open the repository.
2. Click `Open` to open the repository in VSCode.

### Step 6: Git Integration in VSCode
1. **Initialize a Repository:**
   - If you are starting a new project, you can initialize a new Git repository by opening the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), typing `Git: Initialize Repository`, and selecting it.
2. **View Changes:**
   - The `Source Control` tab (Ctrl+Shift+G) shows your changes.
   - You can see modified files, staged files, and untracked files here.
3. **Stage Changes:**
   - Click the `+` icon next to the files to stage them.
   - Alternatively, you can stage all changes by clicking the `+` icon in the `Changes` header.
4. **Commit Changes:**
   - Enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the `Source Control` panel.
   - Click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.
5. **Push/Pull Changes:**
   - Click the ellipsis (...) at the top of the `Source Control` panel to access more Git commands.
   - Select `Push` to push your changes to the remote repository.
   - Select `Pull` to pull changes from the remote repository.

### Step 7: Branching and Merging
1. **Create a Branch:**
   - Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type `Git: Create Branch`, and select it.
   - Enter a name for your new branch.
2. **Switch Branches:**
   - Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type `Git: Checkout to`, and select it.
   - Choose the branch you want to switch to.
3. **Merge Branches:**
   - Switch to the branch you want to merge into (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type `Git: Merge Branch`, and select it.
   - Choose the branch you want to merge from.

### Step 8: Resolve Merge Conflicts
1. **Identify Conflicts:**
   - If there are conflicts, Git will mark the conflicting files.
2. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - Open the conflicting files and decide which changes to keep.
   - Remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<`, `======`, `>>>>>>`) and save the file.
3. **Commit Resolved Changes:**
   - Stage the resolved files.
   - Commit the changes with an appropriate message.

### Step 9: Push and Pull Changes
1. **Push Changes:**
   - Click the ellipsis (...) in the `Source Control` panel.
   - Select `Push` to push your commits to the remote repository.
2. **Pull Changes:**
   - Click the ellipsis (...) in the `Source Control` panel.
   - Select `Pull` to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository.

### Step 10: Using GitHub Extensions in VSCode
1. **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues Extension:**
   - Install the `GitHub Pull Requests and Issues` extension from the VSCode Marketplace.
   - This extension allows you to create, view, and manage GitHub pull requests and issues directly from VSCode.
2. **GitLens Extension:**
   - Install the `GitLens` extension from the VSCode Marketplace.
   - GitLens provides advanced Git capabilities, including visualizing code authorship, browsing repository history, and more.

### Additional Tips
- **SSH Authentication:**
  - Consider setting up SSH keys for authentication with GitHub for added security.
- **Sync Changes:**
  - Regularly sync your local repository with the remote repository to avoid conflicts.

By following these steps, you can effectively use GitHub with VSCode on Windows, making your workflow smoother and more efficient.
